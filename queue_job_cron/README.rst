Installation
============

To install this module, you need to:

#. Just install it.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to a scheduled action, a flag "Run as queue job" will allow you to run
the action as a queue job. You will also allowed to select a channel of its
execution.
To configure dedicated channels please refers to queue_job help: https://github.com/OCA/queue/blob/12.0/queue_job/README.rst

Channels can be used to manage sequential jobs and prevent concurrency accesses.
To do that you just have to define a channel per cron limited to 1 at time.

Changelog
=========

16.0.2.0.0 (2024-01-08)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Features**

- By default prevent parallel run of the same cron job when run as queue job.

  When a cron job is run by odoo, the odoo runner will prevent parallel run
  of the same cron job. Before this change, this was not the case when the
  cron job was run as a queue job. A new option is added to the cron job when
  run as a queue job to prevent parallel run. This option is set to True by
  default. In this way, the behavior is now the same as when the cron job is run
  by odoo but you keep the possibility to disable this restriction when run as
  a queue job. (`#612 <https://github.com/OCA/queue/issues/612>`_)
